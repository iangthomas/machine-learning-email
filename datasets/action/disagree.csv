11,"Hi - I just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday.  
Three people spoke at the meeting - Jeff McMahon, Louise and Philippe.  There 
was a lot of attention given to EnronOnline and it's success.  Greg Whalley 
spoke via satellite from London.  The basic theme was what it is going to 
take to survive in today's fast moving markets and how we are going to get 
there, and that in five years all businesses will be Internet companies or 
not companies at all.....  

Greg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand 
existing platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do 
this but us because of our financial capabilities, reputation, and IT 
resources.  

Louise went over statistics, products offered, etc. on EnronOnline.

Philippe discussed all the IT projects in the works - the key one for ENA was 
enhancement of deal capture, valuation and settlements (no surprises 
there!).  One other common theme was streamlining our current systems.   He 
also confirmed the fact that we were moving from Lotus Notes to Exchange, and 
discussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our 
equipment (and the ability to keep the room cool) so they were looking to 
Ardmore for this.  

Jeff M. stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on 
inefficiencies in the market, and get into other industries (e.g. MG Metals 
in Europe).  He also stated that Enron was going to Venture Capitalists for 
financial support and backing.  Of course, this means that Enron will have to 
give up some control, but it leads to increased deal flow, market share and 
new ideas....  He said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of 
$1B - most likely in Q3.  

I tried to capture the main topics, let me know if you have any questions!

As I have reflected upon the accomplishments of this group, I wanted to

demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.  

Although we have done much, we have much yet to do.  Therefore, as we go

best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are 
removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to """"take its pulse"""" if you will; 
to help us understand what we do well and not so well; in essence, to assist 
us in acquiring the """"necessary tools"""" and breaking down any """"barriers.""""  SJBC

private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, 
ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.  This collective 
information (who said what is not disclosed) then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to partcipate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  Thank 
you.

I have just reviewed the Merchant Portfolio Summary for 6/20 and have the 
following questions:
 1) CALME shows an asset of $291.9MM  and APACHI shows an asset of $113.0MM 
and they show no p&l for the year
  Is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums 
and commodity prices?
 2) India recently invested in an IPO (rediff.com) for which there was a 
simultaneous DASH to buy and sell (sounds like a Merchant deal).
  Where does this show up?
 3) There are several bonds (publicly traded, registrered securities, housed 
in our Prime Broker accounts) owned by various Enron entities
  that I do not believe are on the DPR.  Shouldn't they be? And if so, who is 
deciding not to include?

As I told you last week, I laid a big egg and ""put the cat amongst the 
pigeons"" as Steve Stock put it.  Phillipe called a meeting with Rick (and 
me), Debbie Brackett and Steve yesterday to ""clear the air"".  While he 
pledged to be attentive to the problem (as I articulated), he still focused 
on fixing process which I fear gets us to where we thought we were as opposed 
to where we need to be.  I continue to believe that not only are there things 
just plain broken, but what we have gotten used to as ""acceptable"" is now 
inadequate.  This includes the ability for ""human"" systems and processes to 
be automated to avoid stupid downstream data problems as well as improve 
analytics.  You will be cordially invited to be (another) weekly meeting that 
both Rick and Phillipe plan to attend to monitor and guide progress.

51,"We had very successful media briefings in the US last week for Enron Credit.
Overall, the meetings and site demos were a huge success and all of the 
reporters seemed
to genuinely benefit from the site demo of Enron Credit.  Below is a quick
recap of John Sherriff's and Jeff Kinneman's media briefing schedules, as
well as some additional notes and an article resulting from one of the
demos.


John Sherriff held briefings with reporters from the following publications:

DerivativesWeek
Dow Jones
Fortune Magazine
Bondweek
Investor's Business Daily
Financial Times
BusinessWeek

Jeff Kinneman held briefings with reporters from the following publications:

Risk Magazine
Institutional Investor
Wall Street & Technology
Derivatives Strategy
Pensions & Investments
Power Finance & Risk


We are already beginning to see results based on the demos.  As you know, Dow 
Jones wrote
a story on Enron Credit following the site demo; the article appeared on
April 4, 2001. It is pasted below for your review. CFO.com also ran a story 
on Enron Credit last week.
In the next few weeks we expect to see stories in Bondweek, BusinessWeek,
DerivativesWeek and Derivatives Strategy.

I will keep you posted on the European Briefings as well.

Below is a summary of our activities this past week

Accomplishments:
Delivered workshops at NEPCO
Gained agreement with NEPCO on status of showstopper reports
Scheduled India' s workshops for next week
Rolled out (to NEPCO) the user manuals developed


Upcoming:
Complete gathering of data points and begin to layout longer term strategy 
(Elaine and Kim)
Develop additional workshops (design and data flow, consolidations and 
intercompany)
Develop and deliver second evaluation
Roll out manuals to user group in Houston 


Where are we at?
We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation 
to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting 
out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of 
management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR 
and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I 
don't understand what the data is telling me. 

This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data 
in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available 
and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions 
(upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big 
learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand 
their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure 
out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1 
training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.

Thanks, again if you have any questions please contact Melissa, Greg or 
myself.

Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
following.

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
Commissioner).  

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
FERC do """"its part"""" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.

Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.

Overall, the """"no price cap"""" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
under considerable pressure to give in to caps).

The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
letter.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.
