"3X52SWXE0W4ZXL6ERQ6NAA4IIT1WC1","I do have a 
few other thoughts to share that may be helpful for the California folks.

The format, although somewhat informal, had a  court reporter present and 
transcripts will be published. Each state was invited to have 2 
representatives and one of the 2 had to be a Commission member.  Opening 
comments were taken from each state and then specific topics were discussed.  
Herzberg participated primarily in the opening discussion. 

He came across as very sincere---indicated that they were working """"around the 
clock"""" to take care of their problems, but that they cannot do it alone.  He 
asked for FERC to help get Califonia to """"stabilization"""" and specifically 
asked FERC for three actions:  an 18 month temporary price cap on 
electricity,  an 18 month temporary price cap on natural gas prices and to 
prohibit any withholding of pipeline capacity to California.  

He was treated very respectfully (which was not as evident  in the comments 
to Commissioner Brown), and I think he did his cause some good.  Much more so 
that in other venues when I've seen other reps from Davis's office speak.  
Breathitt came to California's defense at some point in the discussion.

Commissioner Brown did his share of ranting about EVERYBODY knowing that 
market manipulation is taking place and that the bastards were going to pay 
for their misdeeds (ok..he didn't use those words, but his message was clear)

Lastly, the Chair of the Montana was the most vocal and honest in his 
comments to the California partcipants stating, in part,  """"why should Montana 
ratepayers be taking the hit because California didn't build power plants.""""","A8NUCTL00M11Q","Read Later","2017-09-11 17:23:22 UTC"

I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
following.

Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
Commissioner).  

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
FERC do """"its part"""" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.

Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.

Overall, the """"no price cap"""" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
under considerable pressure to give in to caps).

The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
letter.

Yep, I'll fax the hotel today or tomorrow and let them know our lodging
dates. I've already received the lodging dates from the Brouwers and
Rasmussens.

Ai Ping and I are doing fine. The weather in Wuxi the last week has been
heavenly. The wedding planning is going ok. It will all hopefully take shape
in the next month. The post-wedding travel planning will be done during this
period also, we have to wait to purchase plane tickets, etc.

Hope you liked the wedding invitations. The Chinese don't have special
wedding invitations printed for themselves. They just buy them and write out
the details. Fine with me. I didn't include RSVP details because it seemed
pointless: everybody who's planning to come to the wedding already knows
about it. The others don't need to write back and tell me they can't come.

Go ahead and bring Ai Ping's parents a small gift- that would be nice. It
needn't be big, or expensive, just something to let them know you're happy
to meet them.

Glad to hear that Uncle Darrel and Grandpa Jack were able to come over for
Easter dinner. Should I mail them wedding invitations? I don't want to
exclude them from the process just because they can't attend the wedding.

Sounds like the trip to Beijing will be a circus. That's fine: there is
power in numbers. When we're gawked at we can return in unison open-mouthed
expressions of befuddlement. We'll be a parade of big-noses. We should
charge admission.

1.  Until the end of 2001 to engage other parties with information gathered 
from Enron through the joint effort (values, curves, volatilities, 
presentations, text, etc.)
2.  Until the end of 2002, to utilize ENE's name or our interest in a 
transaction with them as material information to be shared through financial 
releases or non-material marketing information relases.
3.  Engaging, until the end of 2001, with agreements with other energy 
outfits that include both financial as well as physical upgrades to their 
system.
4.  Utilizing ENE's financing structures and accounting with other parties.

"3DW3BNF1GGHK6TGWK4LMMMPLLTF8VY","Wanted to thank you again for reviewing the strategy as simple rules 
article.  It is forthcoming in the next Harvard Business Review and will send 
you some reprints once the magazine hits the newsstands. 

Also wanted to gauge your interest in a possible even at the Harvard Business 
School in April 2001.  We are currently finalizing our plans for the 
Entrepreneurial Manager--a first year course on entrepreneurship taken by all 
1,000 of our MBA students.  As part of the course, we will feature an 
entrepreneurial company as the capstone class in the course.  Last year we 
featured Intuit, taught an Intuit case study and hosted Scott Cook who spoke 
to the entire MBA class.  The session was a huge success--the highest rated 
class in our course and had a lasting impact on how our students think about 
entrepeneurship.  We were wondering whether you and your colleagues might be 
interested in being our featured company this year.  

If you decided to proceed, we would first write a case study focused on the 
process of creating new ventures within Enron.    The case would probably 
consist of three portions:  an overview of the Enron corporation, an in-depth 
description of one or two ventures successfully formed in the past, and a 
profile of someone currently attempting to start a new venture within 
Enron.   In preparing the case, we would draw heavily on existing case 
studies, articles, and book chapters profiling Enron to avoid duplicating 
effort.   We would then supplement our desk research by interviewing 
approximately 15-20 Enron employees, including top management team members 
(especially Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling), some folks involved in past ventures, 
and the people currently attempting to start a new venture.  Each interview 
would take approximately 60 minutes.  We could probably complete the bulk of 
the interviews in a two to three day visit to Enron, supplemented by 
telephone interviews.  The ideal timing for these interviews from our 
perspective would be the last week of November or the first few weeks of 
December.  We would then return to Boston, write a draft of the case and then 
submit that to you for review and clearance in January.  We could then make 
any last minute changes before distributing the case to the students for the 
April discussion.  

In addition to writing the case study, we would like to invite a group of 
Enron executives to HBS when we discuss the case in April.    The ideal date 
would be the 27th of April, but we could schedule the Enron day the 23rd, 
24th or 25th if the 27th were impossible for you.  Last year Intuit sent 
along six folks--some junior, some senior--each of whom sat in at least one 
of our class discussions.  In addition, Scott Cook spoke to the entire MBA 
class.  We would like to follow the same format this year, so it would be 
super if either Jeff or Ken (or in the best of all worlds, both!) could speak 
to the MBAs as a whole.  With Intuit last year, we kicked off at about 8:30 
and wrapped everything up by approximately 1:00.  We would shoot for roughly 
similar timing this year.  

Many of our students equate entrepreneurship with start-ups, and this day is 
designed to show them that it is possible (although extremely difficult) for 
large companies to be entrepreneurial.  As such, you and your colleagues 
would be providing an invaluable service to our students, and we would be 
deeply grateful for your contribution.  The event might also have some direct 
benefits to Enron in terms of increased profile among our students.  If you 
were interested, we could also explore opportunities to leverage this event 
to further increase Enron's profile as a leader of the New Economy.  We 
might, for instance, bundle the case study with a teaching note and edited 
video as a module on """"entrepreneurship in large companies"""" and distribute it 
to other business schools through Harvard Business School press.  My 
colleagues and I would be most grateful for your cooperation and would be 
happy to explore ways that you might increase your return on the time 
invested.  

Please let me know if this opportunity might be of interest to you and your 
colleagues and how you would like to proceed.  I very much look forward to 
hearing from you.

 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.
