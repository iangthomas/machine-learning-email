"3OLZC0DJ8IEDVZS9TQXDZBJZOPJIVF","Hiring Managers, 

Here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a 
offer to your candidates.   

All applicants must fill out and sign an Application and a Fair Credit 
Reporting Act form (included with the application) prior to being 
interviewed.   You may either have the applicant fill out a form before you 
interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36th floor to fill out 
the forms before you interview them.     
Notify Hector McLoughlin or Frank deJesus if you are interviewing an external 
candidate that is a former Enron employee.    All previous Enron employees 
will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview.   
We hope that this process will eliminate re-hiring poor performers. 
If you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a Management 
Position, please include Sally Beck in the process for input.    As a final 
step of the selection process, Sally would like to meet with the candidate if 
time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative.    Sally's 
involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a 
potential Management new hire. 

Thanks for your help with this process.

"324N5FAHSWA41UIXTTIPCRYCGT8VK3","Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash 
application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be 
kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the 
business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that 
Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  
I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.

Two Years Ago	Today
Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in 
place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of 
existence of signed agreement.
Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across 
counterparties.
Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain 
separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial 
together.
All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in 
Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in 
physical Gas.
Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to 
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Although gas 
settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this 
functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by 
financial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating 
cost of funds by commercial team.
The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line 
tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing 
data, rather than using the on-line functionality.
Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be 
classified as """"on account"""", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case 
management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account 
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.
The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the 
counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.	Given the number of legal 
entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties 
have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash 
seems easier.
Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be """"settled"""" with cash 
movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be """"settled"""" with cash 
movement.

Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:
Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify
Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP
Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP
Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify

Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face 
two problems in Unify.  
Controls built into Unify are already obsolete.
Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net 
across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) 
impossible.

Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no 
controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the 
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable 
within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at 
the time of finaling a payment in Unify.

To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to 
SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  
Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this 
decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any 
additional time for consideration.

"3MDKGGG61PMIPNTJMUO91Q59ID8T6G","I assume this meeting is strictly for Accenture and PWC to pitch their vision 
to Enron on how they would help add value or help Enron execute mid/back 
office and/or CommodityLogic in a commercial manner.  I don't want this 
meeting related at all to Andy's efforts with Accenture related to 
transaction feeds unless Andy thinks it is OK.

I have told Baldwin at Accenture that Mid/back office and CommodityLogic is 
separate from what he is working on with Dave Samuals and Andy on Transaction 
hubs and is separate from DealBench, etc.  If we are not careful, Accenture 
will be working with four or five different points of contact at Net Works 
and we will end up hurting ourselves.

I am counting on Salley, Rex, Andy and Tom ASAP to each understand what the 
other is doing with Accenture and make sure there is no way Accenture can 
work us to our disadvantage. I also think Accenture needs to earn our 
business because others can do what they are offering.

Also, check with Rex Shelby on PWC.  We just had an uncomfortable experience 
with PWC that everyone should understand.  I recommended an Accenture meeting 
but if Tom wants PWC, he should understand what they did to Rex.

Remember, all of this is very confidential so let's be very careful 
internally and no meetings without transaction specific NDAs.

Your thoughts?

I am out next week but will check voice mail daily at 36635.

Good luck.

goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC

Below is a summary of our activities this past week

Accomplishments:
Delivered workshops at NEPCO
Gained agreement with NEPCO on status of showstopper reports
Scheduled India' s workshops for next week
Rolled out (to NEPCO) the user manuals developed


Upcoming:
Complete gathering of data points and begin to layout longer term strategy 
(Elaine and Kim)
Develop additional workshops (design and data flow, consolidations and 
intercompany)
Develop and deliver second evaluation
Roll out manuals to user group in Houston 


Where are we at?
We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation 
to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting 
out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of 
management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR 
and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I 
don't understand what the data is telling me. 

This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data 
in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available 
and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions 
(upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big 
learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand 
their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure 
out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1 
training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.

Thanks, again if you have any questions please contact Melissa, Greg or 
myself.

"3WRKFXQBOA6UZTNEY1KX6ANT66LIYO","FYI

I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  

 I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is a short one.","A2WGW5Y3ZFBDEC","Read Later","2017-09-11 17:26:02 UTC"
"3ECKRY5B1PVU4JXJUNMGKHWVC0PIZF","The attached memo details our proposal of a week ago to use SAP AR rather 
than Unify AR.  As of this morning, we finalized our decision to use the SAP 
AR system and to turn off Unify AR when SAP is implemented.  Please direct 
any questions to myself at X33179 or Melissa White at X35704.

Please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I may have forgotten who is 
interested.

But I assume the invitation will be extended to all of their groups so that 
whoever they want can attend. 

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the 
groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an 
offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letting 
them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One on 
ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We need 
to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

"3E9ZFLPWOXR5ZOX4T5YVNWGK40RIXI","We need to run a little project over the next week or so.

I think it is time that you have someone inventory all the projects you have going in your group, sit down and go over them with me and then you and I make sure they still have support from a business unit or make sense at all.  Some of them involve IT resources and some don't.

I just want to take a breath for a moment and make sure every project you are doing (outside the daily operations that are so critical) is necessary and still has a sponsor at a business unit.  If not, we can stop several side projects and focus on the critical ones, save some money and make sure we get the 5 to 10 things that absolutely have to be done completed.

Your thoughts?

"3UUIU9GZC44M6JT5HBE49KR9MIXT50","Have a good vacation.

 I talked to Rahil and he is going to focus a significant amount of his time 
with your team, from an origination perspective, on what you and I discussed 
yesterday.  We are also dedicating an analyst full time, that works for Marc 
Eichman in structuring, to work with Rahil and your team on getting the 
business plan and modeling completed for commercialization.

I am seeing Tom Gros today at 3 PM to discuss with him what I discussed with 
you yesterday.

Can we meet again this Thursday with you, your commercialization team and 
Rahil, Marc and the analyst to agree on what we want to accomplish in the 
next week or so?

Let me know your thoughts.
