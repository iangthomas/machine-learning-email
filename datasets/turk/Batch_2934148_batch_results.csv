"32L724R85KJ0QFVD7EOETJUH21GIPS","I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to ""catch up"", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.  ","A1B1JQW3W13ODO","Action Required","2017-09-11 15:49:56 UTC"

"38Z7YZ2SB21LQRWS7R33TOKR7X2IQJ","We have created four additional graphs to be published daily along with the 
DPR: 

Return on VaR (ROVAR)
Curve Shift P&L (Delta - Gamma) Sharpe Ratio
Risk - Return (Large)
Risk - Return (Small)

All of these graphs deal with the concept of risk-adjusted return.  The 
markets in which we operate have unlike risk characteristics.  Furthermore, 
Enron's appetite for risk also differs in each market.  As a result, it is 
difficult to compare returns in absolute terms.  Therefore, the approach of 
these graphs is to divide return by a measure of risk, in effect restating 
return numbers into a standard base (how many dollars we earn for every 
dollar we put at risk).


 For each business unit or commodity group, the ROVAR graph shows an average 
of daily total P&L divided by an average of daily VaR.  Higher ROVARs 
indicate better performance (relative to other business units).  For each 
business unit or commodity group there are two bars: the dark blue on the 
left shows ROVAR on a 4 week (20 business day) rolling basis, and the light 
blue on the right shows ROVAR on a 1 week (5 business day) rolling basis.  
Because of the shorter term, the 1 week ROVAR is more sensitive: it can be 
quite high or low, and it changes frequently.


The Sharpe Ratio graph is very similar in concept; it shows an average of 
daily curve shift P&L (both delta and gamma) divided by its standard 
deviation. This Sharpe ratio is uncomplicated by non-trading P&L (like new 
deals, reserves, and so forth).  Furthermore, whereas VaR is a forward 
looking statistic (the most we are likely to lose in one day with a given 
probability), standard deviation is backward looking (the actual volatility 
of our returns over the period). This graph also has two bars for every 
business unit or commodity group: a dark brown on the left showing the Sharpe 
ratio on a 4 week rolling basis, and a light brown on the right showing the 
ratio on a 1 week basis.

The Curve Shift P&L Sharpe Ratio and the ROVAR graphs complement each other 
well.  They measure different things, but if our P&L is composed mostly of 
curve shift, and if our VaR closely predicts curve shift volatility, the two 
statistics should be very close.


Sometimes it is interesting to see the actual magnitude of the P&L relative 
to the risk.  We therefore put together the Risk - Return graphs.  On the 
vertical axis, they show 4 week rolling average P&L.  On the horizontal, they 
show 4 week rolling average VaR.  The various business units are plotted as 
points on the graphs.  These graphs are closely related to the 4-week ROVARs, 
in that the vertical value of every point divided by its horizontal value is 
the business unit's ROVAR (average P&L / average VaR).  Another way of 
looking at these graphs is that the slope of a line connecting the origin 
(0,0) with the plotted point of a business unit is its ROVAR.  Books with 
small risks and returns (< $2 million) are plotted on the ""Small"" graph, and 
the rest, on the ""Large"".

These graphs are based on the DPR Database that we built to standardize and 
capture the information that is reported in the DPR.  Most, but not all of 
the information in the DPR currently flows from the database.  As a result, 
we do not have ROVARs or Sharpe Ratios for every business unit.  As we 
continue to set up exports into the database, we will fill in the missing 
numbers.

We will e-mail you these graphs every day until we can publish them on the 
intra-net.  Please remember to launch the file in Excel, instead of using the 
Lotus Notes viewer.  The VaR Limit Usage graphs that we created last week are 
already on the web.  We hope that you find all of these useful.

"3R5LWXWHRZ7R3XR93HYS2K34PNXXG3","Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?

Please find attached two presentations on current position/challenges with 
the Metals group and inventory balances in particular. 

The former outlines the 'Control' view of integration efforts - past, current

The latter is a summarised response to your earlier concerns over inventory

As I told you last week, I laid a big egg and ""put the cat amongst the 
pigeons"" as Steve Stock put it.  Phillipe called a meeting with Rick (and 
me), Debbie Brackett and Steve yesterday to ""clear the air"".  While he 
pledged to be attentive to the problem (as I articulated), he still focused 
on fixing process which I fear gets us to where we thought we were as opposed 
to where we need to be.  I continue to believe that not only are there things 
just plain broken, but what we have gotten used to as ""acceptable"" is now 
inadequate.  This includes the ability for ""human"" systems and processes to 
be automated to avoid stupid downstream data problems as well as improve 
analytics.  You will be cordially invited to be (another) weekly meeting that 
both Rick and Phillipe plan to attend to monitor and guide progress.
