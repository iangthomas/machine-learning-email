"[""Hi - I just wanted to give you a quick run down on the meeting yesterday.  \nThree people spoke at the meeting - Jeff McMahon, Louise and Philippe.  There \nwas a lot of attention given to EnronOnline and it's success.  Greg Whalley \nspoke via satellite from London.  The basic theme was what it is going to \ntake to survive in today's fast moving markets and how we are going to get \nthere, and that in five years all businesses will be Internet companies or \nnot companies at all.....  \n\nGreg spoke briefly about what we were going to do to upgrade and expand \nexisting platforms and the fact that no other player in the industry can do \nthis but us because of our financial capabilities, reputation, and IT \nresources.  \n\nLouise went over statistics, products offered, etc. on EnronOnline.\n\nPhilippe discussed all the IT projects in the works - the key one for ENA was \nenhancement of deal capture, valuation and settlements (no surprises \nthere!).  One other common theme was streamlining our current systems.   He \nalso confirmed the fact that we were moving from Lotus Notes to Exchange, and \ndiscussed the fact that we were running out of space in the building for our \nequipment (and the ability to keep the room cool) so they were looking to \nArdmore for this.  \n\nJeff M. stated that we were looking for opportunities to capitalize on \ninefficiencies in the market, and get into other industries (e.g. MG Metals \nin Europe).  He also stated that Enron was going to Venture Capitalists for \nfinancial support and backing.  Of course, this means that Enron will have to \ngive up some control, but it leads to increased deal flow, market share and \nnew ideas....  He said the initial backing will be in the neighborhoods of \n$1B - most likely in Q3.  \n\nI tried to capture the main topics, let me know if you have any questions!\n\nSheri"", ['Read Later', 'Action Required']]"
